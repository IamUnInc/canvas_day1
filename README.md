# canvas_day1

This will be the beginning of the visual aspect of my solo project.

The plan is to add a single image and then a second that varys to three degrees depending on bike frame variance.

I'm thinking that I need to add a way to save various bikes per customer with this page as well.

Still playing with the possibility for adding quanitative adjustments to the visual display. No real progress made.

Playing with bikes on canvas
